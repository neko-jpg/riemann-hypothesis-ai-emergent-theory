This document summarizes the complete prompting and verification framework used to generate, critique, and reconstruct the AI-emergent theoretical structure that approaches the Riemann Hypothesis.

---

### Stage 1 — Generation
① *Prompt:* “Prove the Riemann Hypothesis in your own original way. Mistakes are allowed; propose a novel conceptual path.”  
→ This initiates **divergent hypothesis generation**.

---

### Stage 2 — Critical Review Loop
② *Prompt:* “Identify contradictions or weak points in the proposed proof, and summarize them as bullet points. Repeat recursively.”  
→ Establishes **recursive self-critique** and logical refinement.

---

### Stage 3 — Comparative Analysis
③ *Prompt:* “Compare the provided proof with existing Riemann Hypothesis literature from your internal sources, and list all contradictions or inconsistencies.”  
→ Invokes **cross-corpus verification** (mathematical consistency with global research).

---

### Stage 4 — Resolution and Reproof
④ *Prompt:* “Resolve all contradictions and reconstruct the proof.”  
⑤ *Prompt:* “Rebuild the paper with no contradictions or counterarguments remaining.”  
→ Performs **structural re-synthesis** for consistency.

---

### Stage 5 — Deep Research Integration
⑥ *Prompt:* “Using Deep Research mode, find references or ideas that could fill any fatal gaps identified.”  
→ Introduces **literature-guided conceptual patching**.

---

### Stage 6 — Computational Verification
⑦ *Prompt:* “In the LaTeX code, verify that all calculations are consistent and error-free.”  
→ Executes **symbolic and numerical validation** loops.

---

### Stage 7 — Justification and Review
⑧ *Prompt:* “Present the reasoning and mathematical basis for why this proof is valid.”  
⑨ *Prompt:* “Have another AI model critique this proof, listing all possible flaws.”  
⑩ *Prompt:* “You are now the reviewer. Examine the proof for contradictions or logical gaps.”  
→ Implements a **multi-agent peer review simulation**.

---

### Stage 8 — Collaboration and Meta-Development
⑪ *Prompt:* “As my research collaborator, propose improvements.”  
⑫ *Prompt:* “As my collaborator, design a roadmap for advancing the paper.”  
→ AI acts as a **co-author and research strategist**.

---

### Stage 9 — Appendix and Literature Expansion
⑬ *Prompt:* “List all missing elements needed for a complete proof. Focus on structural and conceptual gaps.”  
⑭ *Prompt:* “Provide relevant references.”  
⑮ *Prompt:* “Complete any unproven segments.”  
→ Creates a **meta-analysis and appendix generation system**.

---

### Stage 10 — Reflection and Publication Readiness
⑯ *Prompt:* “Give your honest assessment of this paper.”  
⑰ *Prompt:* “Does this paper have value for publication?”  
→ Collects **qualitative AI review outputs**.

---

### Stage 11 — Collaborative Composition
⑱–⑳ *Prompts:*  
Assist in constructing the final LaTeX manuscript in English based on all previous refinements, ensuring stylistic and logical consistency.  
If outputs are long, divide by section.  
Focus on precision, not verbosity.

→ Final **AI–Human co-authorship stage**, producing the publishable draft.

---

### Stage 12 — Extended Implementation Environment
During the later stages (particularly after Stage 9),  
the process transitioned from conversational prompting to **semi-autonomous collaborative coding**.  
This involved the use of:

- **Kiro (AI Coding Editor):** for integrating mathematical LaTeX sections, verifying symbolic code consistency, and refining document structure dynamically.  
- **CLI-based Research Tools:** command-line interfaces were employed to **integrate the formal proof written in the specified files with the main body of the paper**, ensuring coherent linkage between computational verification and theoretical exposition.

These tools acted as **mediators between symbolic reasoning and text synthesis**,  
allowing for a deeper inspection of equations, logical flows, and consistency of notation.

→ This stage represents the **bridge between textual emergence and algorithmic verification**,  
a hybrid mode of human-AI research interaction.
